### Let's API

We are learning about what an API is and how to make one these upcoming weeks. All code will be committed to this repo if we need to refer back to it.

Session 1: Download the template and create a Post method to retrieve a single movie from the database.
Session 2: Create a client that interacts with the API.
Session 3: Create a Dockerfile for the API to enable simple deployment and scaling.
